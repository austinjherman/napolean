# Napolean
A really simple file-based cms for quickly building small websites.

## Installation

### Requirements
* PHP >= 5.4
* Apache Server with mod_rewrite enabled

### Process
* If you don't have composer installed, get it here: [https://getcomposer.org/](https://getcomposer.org/)
* Run `composer install` in the project's root directory

### INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY
Change this variable to whatever your installation directory is. For example, if you are on localhost and you
install this in the /napolean directory, then that's your installation directory. At root, your installation directory
would be '/'.
